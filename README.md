# qrcode_attendance
This is my personal project. I want to digitalise school attendance system in Indonesia.

## How it works: 
We need 1 qrCode reader that connected to a microcontroller. The microcontroller must be already set-up and injected with the program in deviceReceiver folder.
There will also be an android application that you can log in as a student or parent. 
When you arrive at school, click `generate attendance-in QR`. Then scan the QRCode to your school's QR Reader device.
This will collect your attendance info. 
The attendance info can be seen by you, your teacher, and your parents
